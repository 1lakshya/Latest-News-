Introduction
NewsApp is a simple Python application built using the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for displaying top headlines from a news API. The application fetches news data from the NewsAPI service and presents it in a user-friendly manner.

Features
Display top headlines from the NewsAPI for a specific country (in this case, India).
View news details including the headline, image, and description.
Navigate through news articles using "Prev" and "Next" buttons.
Open the full news article in a web browser for more details.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter library
Requests library
Pillow (PIL) library for handling images
NewsAPI key (replace "2cf83045f50c4214aa075d3086e33686" with your own key in the code)
Usage
Install the required libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests Pillow
Replace the placeholder NewsAPI key in the code with your actual key.

Run the NewsApp by executing the script:

bash
Copy code
python news_app.py
The GUI window will open, displaying the top news headline along with an image and a brief description. Use the "Prev" and "Next" buttons to navigate through different articles. Click the "Read More" button to open the full news article in a web browser.
